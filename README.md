# SBA318 - Multiuser Chat Application

A real-time chat lobby system built with Node.js, Express, and a modular database system
supporting both in-memory and MongoDB storage.  The original client code for this I built
for my SBA316 project but I learned after a full day of working on it that I wasn't
going to make it work on time and I bit off more than I can chew.  So my SBA316 didn't
end up what I wanted it to be.

Note: My internet was down at where I sleep so I made zip files as I worked, which is why there are million of check-ins with huge code changes over the span of an hour.
